The assessor should identify a team of 4-8 subject experts and schedule a time and place to perform the assessment.  Limiting the size of the assessment team will make it easier to reach consensus.  The assessment should be done onsite to allow the team to view the manufacturing processes being assessed.  Before the assessment, the assessor and members of the team can review the MRL criteria to gain familiarity with them.  A crucial step of the assessment is defining the scope of the system or sub-system to be assessed.  By defining the scope early on and setting clear limits about what is in or out of scope, the assessment will run smoothly."]
