{"term":"Technology Readiness Assessment (TRA)","definition":"A statutory requirement for Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs) and a regulatory information requirement for all other acquisition programs. It is a systematic, metrics-based process that establishes the maturity of critical technology elements. The TRA may be conducted concurrently with other technical reviews such as the Alternative Systems Review (ASR), System Requirements Review (SRR), or the Production Readiness Review (PDR). The Defense Director for Research and Engineering (DDR&E) is required to conduct an independent TRA of MDAPs prior to Milestone B."},
