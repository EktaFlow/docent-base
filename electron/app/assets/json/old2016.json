To demonstrate that equipment and processes utilize mature technology and are adequate to achieve Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) objectives.  Manufacturing equipment and processes should be based on new technology that is at a TRL of 8 or higher to support a pilot line for LRIP. The program must verify that all manufacturing technology efforts are supported and progressing satisfactory.  This will ensure a that the production yield is sufficient to meet the program development schedule and that rework does not impact program cost and schedule.  A Pilot Line provides verifiable process capability/ performance results to compare with LRIP requirements.

Key measures include process capability charts, cycle time, total manufacturing hours, scrap/rework percentages, first-pass-yield results, realization factors from actual versus standards, and change rates (design and process).

This effort should be done as soon as practical and if at all possible, before the award of the contract where this activity will be performed (e.g. EMD). <br>&#9679; All ACAT programs are required to conduct a Technology Readiness Assessment (TRA) to determine if new technology is being used in the system design.  Manufacturing technology must be considered as part of the TRA.  Reviewing TRA results can provide indication that new manufacturing technology is being used.  The TRA may miss new manufacturing technology however, since TRAs tend to focus on system design.  <br>&#9679; A review of information collected from earlier MRL assessments and findings is another important source of identifying new manufacturing technology insertion.  <br>&#9679; The third and final way is to review each the pilot production lines for all parts of system development to determine if any new equipment or processes are being used.  For introduction of new equipment or processes, one must determine if it is based on introduction of new technology or reengineering of existing manufacturing systems—not based on new technology.  <br>&#9679; A complete audit of the pilot production line equipment and processes can identify new technology being inserted.  <br>&#9679; Once identified, focusing in on specific Statistical Process Control (SPC) measures may not be possible due to lot sizes (i.e., minimal data available), but other performance output measures can also be used to determine process capability (e.g., First Pass Yield, Scrap/Rework, Hours, Cycle Time, etc.). <br>&#9679; Results that fall into expected norms can indicate that new technology is performing up to expectations, but results out of the expected band indicate possible influence of immature manufacturing technology and require a closer look.  <br>&#9679; Root cause analysis of negative results and unexpected outputs may also indicate immature manufacturing technology.",

Program requirements have been communicated and confirmed and supplier quality and delivery performance tracking metrics are in place. To the extent possible, long term agreements with critical suppliers are in place and are managed effectively.  At this phase of the acquisition, the program has entered Full Rate Production (FRP).  FRP entrance criteria have been accepted and passed. As many suppliers as is prudent should be signed to long-term agreements to provide price stability and availability of required materials. The Prime should have metrics in place to monitor the performance of suppliers along with systematic plan for dealing with underperforming suppliers. The supply base should have predictive indicators in place to call attention to potential problems in a proactive manner. The entire supply base should be known and stable with all suppliers aware of and able to support FRP quantities and delivery dates. Planning must be in place to improve the successful move to FRP and eliminate disruptions.  <br><br>Sources of Information: <br>The majority of the information needed will come from the manufacturing/industrial engineering, supplier management and quality departments. <br><br>Questions:<br>1.

So an effective QMS is a critical element in Full Rate Production.  <br><br>Sources of Information: <br>At this stage in the acquisition process data from production units should be available.  Post Milestone C assessment(s) of system performance, including an MRA leading into Full Rate Production, is a primary source of program specific information at this phase.  The manufacturing and quality systems should be defined and proven coming out of the FRP decision, allowing for ongoing efforts to continuously improve quality.<br><br>Questions:<br>1. Have the quality targets been verified on the Full Rate Production (FRP) line?<br>2. Is continuous quality improvement on-going? <br>3. Are statistical controls being applied where appropriate?<br><br>Additional Considerations:<br>&#9679; What quality targets are in place, and what is your status in achieving these targets?<br>&#9679; Does quality data from Rate Production units provide confidence in the QMS which will be used on this program?<br>&#9679; Is there enough flexibility in the QMS to accommodate fluctuating production rates (accelerated production or program delay/stretched out production)?<br>&#9679; Is the QMS compliant with AS9100 C?<br><br>Lessons Learned: <br>&#9679; Following the Full Rate Production decision, there is likely to be a tendency to lose focus on continuous improvement.  There may also be an experience drain as management is moved onto more high risk programs.  Continue to schedule regular reviews of quality metrics and emphasize progress to quality system improvement initiatives to ensure the program’s quality doesn’t regress coming out of Full Rate Production.  Educate any new management entering the program at this phase on the importance of continued focus on quality and continuous improvement.<br>&#9679; The opportunities to reduce cost late in production are often accompanied with more quality risks than management recognizes.  Make sure the impact on quality is addressed when considering production changes during this phase.",

All actions required to produce, test, and deliver acceptable systems on schedule at minimum cost should be documented in the plan.  The Manufacturing plan should address aspects such as process flows, scheduling, tooling, test equipment, plant facilities, material decisions, manpower, manufacturing risk management, producibility, etc.  A draft Manufacturing Plan should be delivered to the Government at the CDR.<br>&#9679; Scheduling – The manufacturing schedule should provide assurance that the necessary resources will be available when needed, that no resources will be overloaded or expended during execution of any manufacturing tasks, and that product delivery dates are indeed achievable.  The planning needed to complete the Pilot Line should be included in the Integrated Master Schedule (IMS).<br>&#9679; Manufacturing Flow – Preliminary assembly and test flows should be developed to show how the product will move through the manufacturing plant from the stock room to the shipping deck.  Activities such as Value Stream Mapping are extremely valuable in developing an efficient flow.  This activity is useful in determining the need for resources and in determining if the manufacturing schedule is achievable.<br>&#9679; Manufacturing Documentation – Adequate manufacturing documentation is necessary to ensure processes, assembly, and test operations are performed correctly.  Manufacturing documentation includes items such as work instructions, test procedures, inspection procedures, kitting procedures, routers, travelers, tooling & test equipment lists, etc.  Preliminary documentation should be completed such that Pilot line build can be effectively accomplished.    <br>&#9679; Manufacturing Risks – Manufacturing risks should have been identified and fed into the overall system risk management process.

Has the material planning system been proven in LRIP, and is it sufficient for Full Rate Production (FRP?<br><br>Additional Considerations: <br>&#9679; What parts do we need to make or buy (Purchasing Plan)? <br>&#9679; How many of these parts do we need (Capacity Plan)? <br>&#9679; When must these parts be available (Detailed Manufacturing Schedule)?<br>&#9679; Have you continued to check GIDEP alerts for obsolete or DMSMS materials?<br>&#9679; The more complex the manufacturing operation the more complex the MRP.  MRP systems generate two basic outputs, the Purchasing Plan and Schedule that lays out when the purchase orders (POs) should be released and when the purchased items should be received in order to support the production dates. <br>&#9679; The second output is the Capacity Plan or Production Schedule. The production schedule details the start and completion dates for steps in the production process (routing) to include how many items will be produced in each batch and what is required from the bill of materials to support the fabrication and assembly.<br><br>Lessons Learned:<br>&#9679; Increasing the production rate capability to FRP requirements effects many aspects of the manufacturing operations.  Proactive planning is critical to ensure that efficient and economical production at these higher rates can be achieved.  <br>&#9679; The Make/Buy decisions and BOM must be stable for effective transition into a high rate production environment.  Changes to these at this phase in the acquisition cycle could introduce manufacturing risks.  Stable decisions also assist in forecasting, impact analysis, component analysis, and other DMSMS-related activities.   <br>&#9679; The MRP system should have been uploaded, utilized and proven-out with the LRIP build.  If the underlying information is even slightly off, then you will have problems with your MRP system.  Past issues have been classified by the saying \"garbage in, garbage out.\"  <br>&#9679; The quality of the following information sources needs to be correct to prevent errors in your MRP system: (1) Master Production System (MPS); (2) Bills of Material (BOM); (3) Inventory and Inventory Status; (4) Lead Times; (5) Production Size; (6) Production Schedule (working times); (7) Quality Data (yield data, scrap, rework and repair, etc.); (8) Safety Stock Levels and Times; and (9) Work-in-Progress Data.<br>&#9679; It is important for engineers and program managers to be aware of GIDEP alerts that will inform them of parts and materials that are either obsolete or about to become obsolete. If no other options are available, a life-time buy of those parts/materials should be considered.",

            "helpText": "A successful Milestone A decision initiates the Technology Development phase. Per DoD Instruction 5000.02, this phase matures technologies, determines the appropriate set of technologies to be integrated into a full system, conducts competitive prototyping of system elements, refines requirements, and develops the functional and allocated baselines of the end-item system configuration. If a platform or system depends on specific technologies to meet system operational threshold requirements in development, production, operation, and sustainment, and if the technology or its application is either new or novel, then that technology is considered a critical or enabling technology. If there are any critical technology elements, they are to be evaluated during the Technology Development phase to assess technology maturity. Technology Development is a focused effort to mature, prototype, and demonstrate technologies in a relevant environment. This results in a preferred system concept that achieves a level suitable for low risk entry into Engineering and Manufacturing Development. This can best result from a close collaboration between the science and technology community, the user, and the engineering community.This phase develops and demonstrates prototype designs to reduce technical risk, validate designs, validate cost estimates, evaluate manufacturing processes, and refine requirements. Based on refined requirements and demonstrated prototype designs, Integrated Systems Design of the end-item system can be initiated. When approved in the Technology Development Strategy, the Integrated Systems Design may be conducted prior to Milestone B, to include full functional analysis of the end-item system, definition of the functional baseline, following the System Functional Review; functional allocation to system configuration items; and establishment of the system allocated baseline following the Preliminary Design Review. Additionally, the Technology Development Phase efforts ensure the level of expertise required to operate and maintain the product is consistent with the force structure. Technology development is an iterative process of maturing technologies and refining user performance parameters to accommodate those technologies that do not sufficiently mature (requirements trades). The Initial Capabilities Document, the Technology Development Strategy, and the maturing draft Capability Development Document (CDD) guide the efforts of this phase, leading to the approved CDD.<br>Competitive prototyping and effective employment of systems engineering, applied in accordance with a well-structured Systems Engineering Plan, and monitored with meaningful technical reviews, will reduce program risk, identify potential management issues in a timely manner and support key program decisions.<br>4.3.2.1.
