          <b>What are the benefits of performing a Manufacturing Readiness Assessment?</b>
        </ion-card-header>
        <ion-card-content>
          Performing a Manufacturing Readiness Assessment is a key factor in identifying and mitigating manufacturing risks.  Following the MRL Criteria will help to address problems before they end up in the production line.  Docent will take you through the process of performing an assessment, and prompt you to create an action plan for any criteria that have not been met.  These plans can be exported from Docent and used to develop a Manufacturing Maturation Plan.
